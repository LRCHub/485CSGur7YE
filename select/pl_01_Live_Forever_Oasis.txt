maybe I don't really
want to know
how your garden grows
cause I just want to fly
lately did you ever
feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks you to the bone
maybe I just want to fly
wanna live I don't wanna die
maybe I just wanna breathe
maybe I just don't believe
maybe you're the same as me
we see things
they'll never see
you and I are gonna
live forever
I said maybe
I don't really wana know
how your garden grows
cause I just wanna fly
lately did you ever
feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks you to the bone
maybe I will never be
all the things that I wanna be
now is not the time to cry
now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
we see things they'll never see
you and I we're gonna
live forever
maybe I don't really
want to know
how your garden grows
cause I just want to fly
lately did you ever
feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks you to the bone
maybe I just want to fly
wanna live I don't wanna die
maybe I just wanna breathe
maybe I just don't believe
maybe you're the same as me
we see things they'll never see
you and I are gonna
live forever
gonna live forever
gonna live forever
gonna live forever
gonna live forever
gonna live forever
gonna live forever
