[00:11.96] Maybe I don't really want to know
[00:17.09] How your garden grows
[00:19.63] I just want to fly
[00:22.68] Lately did you ever feel the pain
[00:28.19] In the morning rain
[00:30.56] As it soaks it to the bone
[00:43.56] 
[00:33.94] Maybe I just want to fly
[00:36.53] I want to live I don't want to die
[00:39.75] Maybe I just want to breath
[00:42.28] Maybe I just don't believe
[00:44.86] Maybe you're the same as me
[00:47.19] We see things they'll never see
[00:49.98] You and I are gonna live forever
[01:05.98] 
[00:57.53] Maybe I don't really want to know
[01:02.56] How your garden grows
[01:05.30] I just want to fly
[01:08.47] Lately did you ever feel the pain
[01:13.29] In the morning rain
[01:15.62] As it soaks it to the bone
[01:28.62] 
[01:18.97] Maybe I will never be
[01:21.70] All the things that I want to be
[01:24.75] But now is not the time to cry
[01:27.45] Now's the time to find out why
[01:30.35] I think you're the same as me
[01:32.77] We see things they'll never see
[01:35.17] You and I are gonna live forever
[03:21.54] We're gonna live forever
[03:27.08] Gonna live forever
[03:32.68] Live forever
[03:43.19] Forever
